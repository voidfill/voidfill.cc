This article is mostly a dummy entry for testing.

# MDX

Astro is great for hosting mostly static sites. It's fast, and it's easy to use. I love it!
It also allows you to use MDX, which is a great way to write content.
It allows you to write JSX in your markdown files, which is great for embedding components.

Heres a simple example:

```tsx
import Theme from "../../components/astro/Theme.astro";

<Theme />
```
Renders to:
<Theme />
The Theme component is a simple webcomponent using signals attached to the window.
[Web components made in astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/#web-components-with-custom-elements) benefit from easy to set-up interactivity and being statically renderable.
Theyre also a great tool to keep bundle sizes small.

## SSR and SSG

Astro allows you to render both server-side and statically. This is great for SEO and performance.
This is the statically rendered version of the post.
